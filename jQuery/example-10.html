		Both Q and jQuery provide a deferred object that hosts the authorities of observing state and changing state. In Q, the deferred has a promise property that is the sole interface for observing state. The resolve and reject functions change state. Only the promise has the promise API in Q. In jQuery, the $.Deferred object is both the promise and the deferred, but it provides a promise() function that can either return the promise part of the API, or put the promise methods on another object.
