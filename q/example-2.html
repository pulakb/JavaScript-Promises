		/* =====
		Think about where the "then" function comes from. Each function creates a new defer instance 
		and returns that object's promise member. That promise object has a "then" function. On return
		from the first function, you get back a defer function, and call the "then" function, passing
		the *next* function that is to be called. Internally, Q stores that function. When your ajax
		call returns, in your "success" function, you call the next function by calling deferred.resolve().
